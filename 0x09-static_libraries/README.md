easy command for creating static library liball.a from the .c files in the directory
* ```gcc -c *.c``` 
* ```ar rc liball.a *.o```
* ```ranlib liball.a```

use ```ls *.c``` to see all files ending with ```.c```.
use ```ar -t staticlibraryname.a``` to view the objects files in it. In this case ```ar -t liball.a``` was used to check all the files in the static library liball.a.
